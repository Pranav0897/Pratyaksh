# Pratyaksh
App for Pratyaksh Project, presented in Open House 2017 @ IITD. This app controls arduino on the armband, giving a vibrotactile feedback to the person wearing it.
TODO: Create the link between this app and Intel RealSenseâ„¢, to allow blind user to navigate freely, guided by the armband we created.
